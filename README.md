create classes based on the pil module to create your own modules

create classes that are all the available enhancements
use argument parsing to apply different filters, and enhancements to directories of the users choice

use the input module to allow the user to determnine where to place edited files

I would like it create thumbnails, black and whites, and other types of images

I also need to incorporate unit testing
